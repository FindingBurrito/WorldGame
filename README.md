# Word Scramble Game ðŸŽ®

This is a simple console-based C++ game where the player is challenged to unscramble randomly shuffled words. The game is designed to demonstrate intermediate-level C++ skills, including:

- Use of classes and objects
- Random word selection and the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
- A scoring system
- Sorting high scores using bubble sort
- File input/output to save and load top scores

When the game starts, you're shown a scrambled word and asked to guess the original. Your score increases with each correct guess. At the end, your name and score are saved and ranked among the top scores in a local file (`highscores.txt`).

This project is meant to showcase practical use of algorithms and structured programming logic in C++. No external libraries are usedâ€”just the standard library.
